# PLTS Monitoring
A monitoring device for solar power plants
This device can read data from the solar panel system, measure current and voltage, and store data using microSD card media. 
In addition, the device has a user interface to display the measured data using an LCD 20x04.

## The block diagram of the solar power system monitoring system, including sensors, microcontroller, and user interface is as follows:

## Description of how the device works in general:
This tool will measure the voltage value generated by a solar panel and the DC electric current that is being flowed.
The measurement results will then be recorded in a certain time interval into a file document in a Micro SD card.

## The type of sensor that will be used to measure the current and voltage of the solar panel:
Current Sensor: ACS712
Voltage Sensor: ACPL-C87B

## Reasons for selecting the sensor:
ACS712
- Output voltage proportional to AC or DC currents
- Low-noise analog signal path
- Commonly used sensor and small output error 1.5% at Ambient temp 25C
- 
ACPL-C87B
- Isolated DC-bus voltage sensing
- High accuracy
- 0.1% non-linearity max
-
