# PLTS Monitoring
A monitoring device for solar power plants
This device can read data from the solar panel system, measure current and voltage, and store data using microSD card media. 
In addition, the device has a user interface to display the measured data using an LCD 20x04.

## The block diagram of the solar power system monitoring system, including sensors, microcontroller, and user interface is as follows:

## Description of how the device works in general:

## The type of sensor that will be used to measure the current and voltage of the solar panel:

## Reasons for selecting the sensor:

## Schematic and PCB design using EDA application (Kicad):

## Create source code for the microcontroller (AVR ATmega 328p)

## Simulate the device design using the Proteus application:
